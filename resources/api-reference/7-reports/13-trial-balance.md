### Get a Single Trial Balance

Sample axios request to get a single Trial Balance

```js
const response = axios.get(
  "https://web.builtaccounting.com/api/accounts/id/balance<date>"
);
```

- `id` represents the id of the Trial Balance you want to get
- `<date>` is the date of the Trial Balance

### Filtering of Trial Balance

To filter trial balance select starting date, and end date then make a `POST` request to the `/transactions/filter/id?from=<start_date>&to=<end_date>` endpoint. Sample request using axios:

```js
const response = await axios.post(
  "https://web.builtaccounting.com/api/transactions/filter/id?from=<start_date>&to=<end_date>",
{
  "id": "TB12345", // The ID of the trial balance
  "from": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z", // Represents the start date of trial balances
  "to": "2024-12-31T23:59:59Z" // Represents the end date of trial balances
},
headers: {
  accept: "application/json",
  authorization: "Bearer <API-KEY>",
  "content-type": "application/json",
},
);
```

The `Response` object returned is the same as the one for getting all trial balances
