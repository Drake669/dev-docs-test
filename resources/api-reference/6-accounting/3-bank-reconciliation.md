### Get a Single Bank Reconciliation

Sample axios request to get a single bank reconciliation.

```js
const response = axios.get(
  "https://web.builtaccounting.com/api/reconciliation/account/id/timeline/"
);
```

- `:id` represents the id of the bank reconciliation you want to get

### Adding a Period

To add a period, you will need to enter the amount and beginning date as it appears on the statement, and enter the amount and ending date as it appears on the statement to add a period.
Make a `POST` request to `/reconciliation/create` endpoint to add a period. Sample request using axios:

```js
const response = await axios.post(
  "https://web.builtaccounting.com/api/reconciliation/create",
  {
  "account_id": "ACC12345", // The ID of the account
  "from": "2024-11-01", // The beginning of the date range
  "to": "2024-11-14", // The ending of the date range
  "starting_balance": 1000.00, // The starting balance of the account
  "ending_balance": 1500.00 // The ending balance of the account
},
  headers: {
  accept: "application/json",
  authorization: "Bearer <API-KEY>",
  "content-type": "application/json"
}
);
```

Here is an example response received after successfully adding a new period:

```json
{
    "account_id": "475620",
    "from": "2024-11-07",
    "to": "2024-11-07",
    "starting_balance": "0",
    "ending_balance": "120",
    "business_id": 1,
    "uuid": "c803e89e-df4f-437e-988b-c1256bb5c473",
    "updated_at": "2024-11-07T11:28:44.000000Z",
    "created_at": "2024-11-07T11:28:44.000000Z",
    "id": 1201
}
```
